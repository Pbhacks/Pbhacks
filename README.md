 ðŸŒ±About MeðŸ”­
---------------
I'm an enthusiast Cybersecurity learner and currently a student who is Pursuing B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering as main stream.
Further, I am also involving myself completely into doing various internships starting from web developement to software developement as,
I want to expand my knowledge as much as possible and, don't want to keep it limited.

âš¡I also like sharing my knowledge with people who are truly dedicated and on receiving the correct opportunity I always try to learn from my seniors,
whether be my Parents, Professors, or/else any seniors.

âš¡Becoming an Chief Information security officer some day is my dream and, also want to become an ethical hacker!!! Trying my level best to use my university days,
to do so and gain as much as information as possible.
